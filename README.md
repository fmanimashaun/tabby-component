# Tabby Component Project
## Overview
The Tabby Component Project is a simple, yet interactive, React application that showcases the use of tabs to display different sets of content. The application features three tabs, each representing a popular franchise: Digimon, PokÃ©mon, and Tamagotchi. When a tab is selected, the corresponding content for that franchise is displayed, providing a seamless user experience.

## Features
Tabbed Interface: The application uses a tabbed interface to organize content. This allows users to easily navigate between different sets of content.

Interactive UI: The application provides visual feedback to the user by highlighting the active tab. This makes it easy for users to understand which tab's content is currently being displayed.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes. This ensures a consistent user experience across different devices.
